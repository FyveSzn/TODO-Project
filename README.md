This project was built by Okechukwu Victor, mentored by Taofeek Olalere and was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Upon launching the code with live servers, a todo list app is shown with an input field that fires an EventListener when 'Enter' key is pressed.
The input field value includes the todotext, time of creating the todo, done and delete button
To edit texts on the todo list, the text item can be double clicked and a span with an input field is shown and edited upon pressing 'Enter'
To delete, click the delete button
To complete the todo, click the done button
